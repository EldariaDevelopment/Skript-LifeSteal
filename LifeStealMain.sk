#                              What You Must Do   
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
#	1. Set Items to {HeartIncrease}, {HeartDecrease}, {Heart},
#		{CombatTimerIncrease}, and {CombatTimerDecrease}.
#		> Use /setitem with the item in your hand.
#	2. With the a single heart item in your hand do /setitemstack
#		and allow it time to set the multi-variable.
#	3. Edit the /Lifesteal configuration to your liking.
#	4. If your just starting use the recommended settting
# 5. For support message Almondz#001 on discord
# 6. Use /TestingGui for more commands and testing features.
